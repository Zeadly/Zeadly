## Bio 
I am an aspiring programmer although I am not sure what field I want to be working in, I am working on a lot of different projects to enhance my existing programming skills 
and I am looking to collaborate with others and work on my own projects in my free time, I am currently a final year student and working on
a multiplayer game. For my final year project I am planning to create my very own dialogue system.
